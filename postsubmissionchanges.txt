changes that would be cool in no particular order

a colour scheme but for real this time
    - why is each dash panel a different colour and why is three of those colours just very slightly different shades of navy thats weird imo
    - why is the stats panel not coloured to match. 

an actual roadmap
    - instead of the timeline thing that never worked
    - with graphics and it looks like a fantasy rpg world map
    - that reflects progress through tasks

task completion
    - modal after you complete tasks that shows your progress in stats and on the worldmap
    - working or faked file upload and text input

stats that make sense
    - avatar customisation
    - stats that update from task completion
    - some sort of metric reflecting user progress

avatar customisation 
    - several cute clothing options
    - choosing a name in onboarding
    - choosing a gender or body type or whatever
    - choosing a 'class' in onboarding
    - full interactivity for intended playthrough, starting with a blank character and then unlocking an item by completing a task and equipping it
        - so like one or two options that unlock and a blank character
    - highly customised example persona character

portfolio sections
    - showing files uploaded and section completion
    - or at the very least quality placeholders on the dash
